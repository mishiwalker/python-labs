'''
Write the necessary code calculate the volume and surface area
of a cylinder with a radius of 3.14 and a height of 5. Print out the result.


'''

r = 3.14
h = 5

# surface area is 2 * pi * r * h + 2 * pi * r squared

surface = (2 * 3.14 * r * h) + (2 * 3.14 * 9.85)

# volume is pi * r squared * h

volume = 3.14 * 9.85 * h

print(surface, volume)
